### Causative and Passive Markers

Voice markers such as -i/hi/li/ki/wu/kwu/chwu- (morphological causative) and -i/hi/li/ki- (suffixal passive) indicate causative and passive voices. They attach to a root to form causative or passive verbs, altering the number of arguments a predicate controls in a clausal construction. We parsed these morphemes and assigned XSV (Suffix, verb derivative) POS tags.

- Example: `mek+ta "to eat" (VV+ EF); mek+hi+ta "to be eaten" (VV+XSV+EF)`

### Auxiliary Verbs

Verbs like iss- "to be/exist/have", ha- "to do", and toy- "to become" can act as both main and auxiliary verbs. As main verbs, they represent concepts of existence, activity, or possession. In these cases, we assigned a VV (Verb, main) tag.

- Example: `ku-nun cha-ka iss-ta "He has a car"`

As auxiliary verbs, they work with a main verb to convey grammatical meanings, such as continuous or progressive actions. In these instances, we assigned a VX (Verb, auxiliary) tag.

- Example: `ku-nye-nun chayk-ul ilk-ko iss-ta "She is reading a book"`

### Copula (Positive)

The copula (-i) links the subject of a sentence with a predicate, often conveying a positive meaning (VCP). Parsing complexities arise when the copula combines with the ending -lanun. This combination links the subject of a sentence to a noun or descriptive phrase, adding a specification, identification, or definition nuance.

- Example: `swukcey-lanun "(the thing) called homework" â†’ swukcey+i+lanun (NNG+VCP+ETM).`

### Spelling Errors

Instead of subjectively interpreting misspelled words, we assigned three tags from the Sejong tag set: NA (Undefined), NF (Undefined, but considered a noun), and NV (Undefined, but considered a verb).
